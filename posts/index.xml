      <description>The 2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV21) is a premier annual technical forum sponsored by the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS), which will be held during 11-17 July 2021 online.
The following contents will be presented.
Driving behavior modeling (DBM) is widely used in the intelligent vehicle field to prevent accidents, which predicts actions that vehicles should take to optimize safe driving behaviors. According to some statistics, accidents easily happen at un-signalized intersections.</description>
